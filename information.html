                    Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element 
                    from any data structure where it is stored. 
                   
                    A <b><em>linear search</em></b> is the simplest method of searching a data set.

                    Starting at the beginning of the data set, each item of data is examined until a match is made. 
                    Once the item is found, the search ends. If there is no match, the algorithm must deal with this.
                    
                    A written description algorithm for a linear search might be:
                    
                    Find out the length of the data set.
                    Set counter to 0.
                    Examine value held in the list at the counter position.
                    Check to see if the value at that position matches the value searched for.
                    If it matches, the value is found. Send a message and end the search.
                    If not, increment the counter by 1 and go back to step 3 until there are no more items to search.
                   
            </pre>

                    <b><em>Binary search</em></b> is the search technique that works efficiently on sorted lists. Hence, to search an element
                    into some list using the binary search technique, we must ensure that the list is sorted.

                    Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the 
                    item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the
                    middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced 
                    through the match.

                    There are two methods to implement the binary search algorithm -

                    1) Iterative method
                    2) Recursive method
